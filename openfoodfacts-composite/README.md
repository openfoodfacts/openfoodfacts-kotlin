# Composite Project

The Composite project 

>[!ERROR] Kotlin Multiplatform does not fully support Gradle Composite builds
>As noted by [Kotlin's YouTrack Issue KT-52172](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-52172), Multiplatform doesn't currently (officially) support composite builds.
>
>In practice; Composite build tasks **do work** as expected.  Lack of support concerns the IDE/code-highlighting experience.
