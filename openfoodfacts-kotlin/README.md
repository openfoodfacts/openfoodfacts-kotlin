## OpenFoodFacts - Kotlin Multiplatform Library


> [!WARNING] This library is in an early development phase
> In its current state this library implements a basic barcode-lookup Product Query via the OpenFoodFacts v0 (Legacy) API .  The aim of this initial implementation is to prove and familiarise OFF developers with Kotlin Multiplatform, though a well understood API surface.  It is hoped that collaborative efforts towards the [current v2 API](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation/) will soon follow.

> [!INFO] This library is not currently published
> If you are looking for a Maven coordinate to include this Library as a dependency in your own App, you won't find one (yet!).
> 
> The library is not in a sufficiently advanced stage of implementation to be published.
